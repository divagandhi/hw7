So here are a couple of suggestions: 1) During the debugging phase, work on a smaller subset of the data. 2) Once you finalize the preprocessing part, you might want to save the preprocessed data in a CSV and work with this CSV so that you don't run the preprocessing part every time you run the notebook.\n",

        "1. Content-based filtering recommends items to a user based on similarity distances between new items/contents and previous items/contents that the user has engaged with. For example, if a user constantly watches action movies, the system will suggest more action movies. Using Netflix as an example, the system may use the genre tags for each movie (ex. titanic may have the genre tag of romance and drama) as features and compare those features with the features of previous items to see if they match (ex. comparing the genre of titanic to the genre of a movie I watched previously like James Bond would give me a low similarity score, so it would not recommend the titanic).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Filter bubbles/echo chambers (they would get recommendations that strongly echo the previous choices or media they have engaged with. This is especially harmful in social media when people only view content that aligns with their political views and they get no exposure to other opinions, thus limiting their worldview). The second negative consequence is popularity bias, where the same super popular content or products would constantly get recommended to users, while those who are just starting their social media accounts or just opening their businesses may have a hard time getting that initial exposure.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. This is based off my understanding from the Piazza post. For real world tasks, we need complex models that would be very computationally expensive to build from scratch (ex. using chatbots in another language). Instead, we can use models that have already been trained on previously large datasets and reuse it to fit the task we want. In the context of NLPs, examples of this would be the Google News pre-trained embeddings, where they already have a large vocabulary/phrase bank, and we don't have to retrain the model, we can simply just plug in a word and it can give us similar words because it has been pre-trained. Another exmaple would be using sentence embeddings instead of BoW representation, giving us a better result because it was already pre-trained (as opposed to us training a model from scratch using BoW). Essentially, you are transferring the learning a model has gotten from the initial bulk pre-training and applying that learning into your own adaptation of a situation."
